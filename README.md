A lightweight, browser-based calculator that computes the **delta-v (Δv)** of a rocket using the **Tsiolkovsky Rocket Equation**. Perfect for aerospace engineering students and enthusiasts exploring fundamental rocket dynamics.

---

## 🧮 The Formula

The calculator implements the **Tsiolkovsky Rocket Equation**, which relates a rocket’s velocity change (Δv) to its exhaust velocity and the ratio of initial to final mass:

Δv = ve × ln(m0 / mf)

Where:
- **Δv** → Change in velocity (m/s)  
- **ve** → Effective exhaust velocity (m/s)  
- **m0** → Initial mass of the rocket (kg)  
- **mf** → Final mass after fuel burn (kg)

## 🧠 Features

- 🚀 Real-time Δv calculation in the browser  
- 🎨 Clean and intuitive UI  
- ✅ Input validation  
- 💻 No dependencies or server required  
- 📚 Educational tool for students learning rocket dynamics

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- HTML5  
- CSS3  
- Vanilla JavaScript (ES6)

## 💡 Example

**Input:**  
- Initial mass (m0): 5000 kg  
- Final mass (mf): 3000 kg  
- Exhaust velocity (ve): 3100 m/s  

**Output:**  
Δv: 1627.66 m/s
